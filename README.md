# Automated Content Engine - Multi-Agent Research

## Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research conducted by a multi-agent swarm to design and plan an **Automated Content Engine** that:

- Monitors Reddit for trending posts across 6 categories
- Generates high-quality blog articles using AI
- Automatically creates relevant images
- Publishes content to WordPress
- Utilizes 5+ specialized agents for end-to-end automation

## Research Methodology

This research leveraged a **multi-agent swarm architecture** with intelligent multi-model routing across:
- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (fast research)
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (deep reasoning)
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (quality content)
